Python - Inheritance
inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This helps in promoting code reusability and creating a hierarchical structure of classes.
Tasks
0.  a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:
Prototype: def lookup(obj):
Returns a list object
1.a class MyList that inherits from list:

Public instance method: def print_sorted(self): that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
You can assume that all the elements of the list will be of type int
2.  a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.

Prototype: def is_same_class(obj, a_class):
3.  a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

Prototype: def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class):
