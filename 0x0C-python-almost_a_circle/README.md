Python - Almost a circle
Import: Python import statement is used to import modules into your current script or module, allowing you to use functions and variables defined in those modules.
Exceptions: Exceptions in Python are errors that occur during execution. You can handle exceptions using try, except, finally, and raise statements.
Class: In Python, classes are used to create objects that encapsulate data and methods that operate on the data. Classes are defined using the class keyword.
Private attribute: Python doesn't have a strict concept of private attributes like some other languages, but you can denote an attribute as private by prefixing it with a single underscore (_). This is more of a convention than a strict enforcement.
Getter/Setter: In Python, you can implement getter and setter methods to control access to attributes of a class. Getter methods retrieve the value of an attribute, and setter methods modify the value of an attribute.
Class method: Class methods in Python are methods that are bound to the class rather than its instances. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator.
Static method: Static methods in Python are similar to class methods, but they don't have access to the class or instance. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
Inheritance: Inheritance in Python allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and allows for creating a hierarchy of classes.
Unittest: unittest is a built-in Python library for unit testing. It provides a framework for organizing test cases and assertions.
Read/Write file: Python provides built-in functions for reading from and writing to files. You can use functions like open(), read(), write(), and close() to perform file I/O operations.
args and kwargs: *args and **kwargs are special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. *args collects positional arguments into a tuple, while **kwargs collects keyword arguments into a dictionary.
Serialization/Deserialization: Serialization is the process of converting objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting serialized data back into objects.
JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. Python provides built-in support for JSON serialization and deserialization through the json module.
